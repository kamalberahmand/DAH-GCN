# DAH-GCN

Implementation of "Dual Adaptive Higher-Order Graph Convolutional Network for Attributed Graph Clustering" published in IEEE TKDE 2025.

## Overview

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of DAH-GCN, a novel approach for attributed graph clustering that processes structural and attribute information through dual views with adaptive higher-order propagation.

## Key Features

- Dual-view architecture for structure and attribute processing
- Adaptive higher-order graph propagation
- End-to-end clustering optimization
- Support for multiple benchmark datasets

## Requirements
